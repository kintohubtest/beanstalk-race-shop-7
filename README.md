# Beanstalk Shop

A small online shop API: catalog, cart, checkout, invoices, shipping and email
notifications. There is no HTTP server; handlers take a request-like object and
return a response-like object, and the tests call the router directly.

```
npm test        # node --test (Node 25 runs the .ts files natively)
```

Modules live in `src/<name>/`: billing, cart, catalog, orders, users, auth,
notifications, inventory and shipping. Shared plumbing is in `src/lib/`
(money helpers, errors, pagination) and `src/db/` (in-memory store and migrations).
Routes are registered in one place, `src/routes.ts`.

## Configuration

Settings come from environment variables (see `src/config.ts`).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SHOP_NAME` | `Beanstalk Shop` | Store name |
| `SHOP_CURRENCY` | `USD` | Currency amounts are formatted in |
| `SHOP_COUNTRY` | `US` | Home country, used for shipping zones |
| `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | How long a login lasts |
| `PASSWORD_COST` | `1024` | scrypt cost for password hashes |
| `MAX_CART_LINES` | `50` | Most distinct products in one cart |
| `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD` | `5` | Available quantity at or below which a product counts as low on stock |
| `PAYMENT_TERMS_DAYS` | `30` | Days between an invoice being issued and falling due |

## Behaviour

- Prices are tax exclusive; tax is worked out per invoice line from the shipping address.
- Standard shipping is charged by destination zone and weight; express costs double.
- A session lasts `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` from login.
- Stock is reserved at checkout and released when an order is cancelled.
- Coupons take a percentage or a fixed amount off and can have a minimum subtotal.
